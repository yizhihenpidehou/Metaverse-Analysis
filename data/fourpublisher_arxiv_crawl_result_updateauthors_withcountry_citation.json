{"title": "A Dynamic Hierarchical Framework for IoT-assisted Metaverse Synchronization.", "publish": "CoRR", "date": "2022", "abstract": "Metaverse has recently attracted much attention from both academia and\nindustry. Virtual services, ranging from virtual driver training to online\nroute optimization for smart goods delivery, are emerging in the Metaverse. To\nmake the human experience of virtual life more real, digital twins (DTs),\nnamely digital replicas of physical objects, are key enablers. However, DT\nstatus may not always accurately reflect that of its real-world twin because\nthe latter may be subject to changes with time. As such, it is necessary to\nsynchronize a DT with its physical counterpart to ensure that its status is\naccurate for virtual businesses in the Metaverse. In this paper, we propose a\ndynamic hierarchical framework in which a group of IoT devices is incentivized\nto sense and collect physical objects' status information collectively so as to\nassists virtual service providers (VSPs) in synchronizing DTs. Based on the\ncollected sensing data and the value decay rate of the DTs, the VSPs can\ndetermine synchronization intensities to maximize their payoffs. In our\nproposed dynamic hierarchical framework, the lower-level evolutionary game\ncaptures the VSPs selection by the IoT device population, and the upper-level\ndifferential game captures the VSPs payoffs, which are affected by the\nsynchronization strategy, IoT devices selections, and the DTs value status,\ngiven VSPs are simultaneous decision makers. We further consider the case in\nwhich some VSPs are first movers and extend it as a Stackelberg differential\ngame. We theoretically and experimentally show that the equilibrium to the\nlower-level game exists and is evolutionarily robust, and provide a sensitivity\nanalysis with respect to various system parameters. Experiments show that the\nproposed dynamic hierarchical game outperform the baseline.", "source": "arxiv", "author": ["Yue Han", "Dusit Niyato", "Cyril Leung", "Dong In Kim", "Kun Zhu 0001", "Shaohan Feng", "Xuemin Sherman Shen", "Chunyan Miao"], "author_location": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.03969", "citation": 7}

However, due to the huge volume of the\ncollected data by IoT devices (e.g., images and videos) and the limited\nbandwidth, the VSP might become unable to retrieve all the required data from\nthe physical world. Furthermore, the Metaverse needs fast replication (e.g.,\nrendering) of the digital copy adding more restrictions on the data\ntransmission delay. To solve the aforementioned challenges, we propose to equip\nthe IoT devices with semantic information extraction algorithms to minimize the\nsize of the transmitted data over the wireless channels. Since many IoT devices\nwill be interested to sell their semantic information to the VSP, we propose a\ntruthful reverse auction mechanism that helps the VSP select only IoT devices\nthat can improve the quality of its virtual copy of objects through the\nsemantic information.

In this paper, we design a user-defined privacy-preserving\nframework with decentralized federated learning for the industrial metaverses.\nTo further improve privacy protection of industrial metaverse, a cross-chain\nempowered federated learning framework is further utilized to perform\ndecentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving data training on both physical\nand virtual spaces through a hierarchical blockchain architecture with a main\nchain and multiple subchains. Moreover, we introduce the age of information as\nthe data freshness metric and thus design an age-based contract model to\nmotivate data sensing among IIoT nodes. Numerical results indicate the\nefficiency of the proposed framework and incentive mechanism in the industrial\nmetaverses.", "source": "arxiv", "author": ["Jiawen Kang", "Dongdong Ye", "Jiangtian Nie", "Jiang Xiao", "Xianjun Deng", "Siming Wang", "Zehui Xiong", "Rong Yu", "Dusit Niyato"], "author_location": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.07384", "citation": 2}

Unique technology capabilities of metaverses have the potential to enhance the conduct of virtual projects, but little is known about virtual worlds in this context. Virtual project teams struggle in meeting stated project outcomes due to challenges related to communication, shared understanding, and coordination. One way to address these challenges is to consider the use of emerging technologies, such as metaverses, to minimize the impact on virtual project teams. Applying a theoretical foundation for virtual teams in metaverses that includes both technology capabilities and the social interaction that takes place in the metaverse environment, we conducted an empirical investigation of project teams in a virtual world setting. The study examined the interplay of communication, representation, interaction, and team process tools with behaviors that led to role clarity, shared understanding, and coordination. While each individual technology capability contributed to project execution and outcomes, much of the power of the environment emerged through the interplay of social behaviors and technology capabilities.

Besides, the enormous business potential hidden in metaverse has drawn a significant amount of funding to conduct a study on it. Technology companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others have set out the expansion of metaverse on a global scale. As a result, metaverse research has gradually increased in various countries, becoming a heated topic in China. The reason behind the metaverse's explosion is that people recognize the enormous future business value it holds. Still, they overlook the reality that education is the largest potential field of metaverse application. The metaverse and education have a natural parallel and overlap in terms of usability. In contrast to traditional education, the shared virtual space in the metaverse allows students to better participate in education and even become teachers of teachers. However, a substantial number of people are pessimistic about the metaverse's development and implementation, believing it to be a hoax. Therefore, a questionnaire scale is designed in terms of knowledge, exposure, current technology, and confidence to count people's faith in applying metaverse in education and teaching in the near future. The obtained survey data survey is analyzed using a combination of online and field visits, using both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The lack of understanding of metaverse, lack of faith in existing technology, and lack of awareness of the application of metaverse in education were determined to be the key variables affecting people's confidence in the future use of metaverse in education.

Peer-to-peer (or peer-assisted) technologies have been widely considered as a desirable complementary solution to efficaciously offload servers in large-scale media streaming applications. However, due to both the bandwidth constraints of heterogeneous users and unpredictable access patterns of latency-sensitive 3D contents, it is very challenging to cut the server bandwidth cost in metaverses. In this paper, we propose a peer-assisted texture streaming architecture to minimize the server bandwidth consumption without degrading the end-user satisfaction. We propose a game-theoretic peer selection strategy which achieves a good trade-off between performance and complexity. Our algorithm is light-weight, and can efficiently utilize the bandwidth of users in a fully decentralized manner by enabling each peer (i.e., user) to quickly select its content providers who can satisfy the requests of the peer within the latency constraint of the content. We evaluate our algorithm through an extensive comparison study based on simulations using realistic data (i.e., avatar mobility traces and textures) collected from Second Life. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the server bandwidth consumption without degrading the user experience.", "source": "acm", "author": ["Ke Liang 0001", "Roger Zimmermann", "Wei Tsang Ooi"], "author_location": ["National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore", "National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore", "National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2072298.2072326\n", "country": ["SG", "SG", "SG"], "citation": 6}

The metaverse is an expansion of the synchronous communication that embraces an effective number of users to share different experiences. The study aims to investigate the students' perceptions towards metaverse system for educational purposes in the Gulf area. The conceptual model comprises the adoption properties, namely trialability, observability, compatibility, and complexity, users' satisfaction, personal innovativeness, and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) constructs. The novelty of the paper lies in its conceptual model that correlates both personal-based characteristics and technology-based features. In addition, the novel approach of hybrid analysis will be used in the current study to perform deep-learning-based analysis of structural equation modelling (SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN). Moreover, the importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) is used in the current study to evaluate the involved factors for their importance and performance. The study identified Perceived Usefulness (PU) to be an essential predictor of the factor of Users\u2019 Intention to Use the Metaverse System (MS). The fact was discovered during ANN and IPMA analysis. Furthermore, this study is practically significant, as it helped the concerned authorities in educational sector in understanding the significance of each factor and allowed them to make efforts and plans according to the order of significance of factors. Another important implication of the study is methodological in nature. It validates that deep ANN architecture can offer deep insight into non-linear relationships shared by various factors of a theoretical model.", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X22000078", "source": "elsevier", "author": ["Iman A.

While focusing on visitors\u2019 museum experience, new display methods employ a variety of digital technologies to provide exhibition content in ways that allow visitors to better understand artifacts on display. However, the majority of such methods rely on one-way means of delivering information. The lack of interaction with visitors and the use of lighting that clearly separates real and virtual spaces have made museums inadequate as experiential spaces. To resolve those problems, this article suggests a plan to deploy content services for visitors\u2019 museum experiences by combining beacons and HMDs. This study establishes the concept of a service, which provides a virtual world experience by connecting a beacon installed in real space, that is, an exhibition room, to an HMD (head-mounted display). Furthermore, the service also incorporates a storytelling feature to diversify user experience by presenting the characteristics of and stories about artifacts. The service design will make both online and on-site museum experiences meaningful. Ultimately, this article presents the exhibition content thus created as Metaverse exhibition content made through an effective combination of augmented reality and a virtual world.", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026840121630175X", "source": "elsevier", "author": ["Hee-soo Choi", "Sang-Heon Kim"], "author_location": ["Dept. of History and Historical Content, Sangmyung University, 20, Hongjimun 2-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03016, South Korea"], "keywords": ["Museum", "Exhibition content", "Augmented reality", "Virtual reality", "Metaverse", "Beacon", "HMD"], "country": ["KR"], "citation": 104}

Nevertheless, the information systems (IS) discipline has neglected immersive VR, given that only a handful of studies have been published in mainstream IS journals. However, the recent advancements in immersive VR technology provide new opportunities for organizations and IS researchers. In light of these points, we reviewed the immersive VR literature to provide a holistic view of opportunities and challenges for organizations and future research directions for the IS field. By examining the technical capabilities of immersive VR and the previous literature, we identified five affordances: , , , , and . Our review of the 151 studies from the IS and related fields synthesized how these affordances were utilized in various research domains. Guided by the affordance-actualization theory, we also identified the strategic opportunities and challenges that come with implementing VR.

This paper proposes the metaverse for aircraft maintenance training and education of Boeing-737, supplied with legacy manuals, 3D models, 3D simulators, and aircraft maintenance knowledge. Furthermore, to navigate and control operational flow in the metaverse, which is strictly followed by maintenance manuals, the context-aware speech understanding module Neuro-Symbolic Speech Executor (NSSE) is presented. Unlike conventional speech recognition methods, NSSE applies Neuro-Symbolic AI, which combines neural networks and traditional symbolic reasoning, to understand users\u2019 requests and reply based on context and aircraft-specific knowledge. NSSE is developed with an industrially flexible approach by applying only synthetic data for training. Nevertheless, the evaluation process performed with various automatic speech recognition metrics on real users\u2019 data showed sustainable results with an average accuracy of 94.7%, Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.5%, and the generalization ability to handle speech requests of users with the non-native pronunciation.

Blockchain technology plays an indispensable role in realizing the independent digital identity and economic system which are the significant attributes of the metaverse. To achieve the cross-universe mechanism and reduce network resource consumption, this paper proposes a cross-chain protocol for the underlying architecture of metaverse that utilizes an identity information chain to guarantee the separate digital identity of users and decrease the data interaction between varied consortium blockchains. However, along with the rapid development of quantum computing, the classical cryptosystems which commonly count on mathematical complexity will not be reliable and secure. The current post-quantum cryptography technologies that increase the time complexity of algorithm will lead to quite low efficiency and high resource overhead while applying to blockchain structures. But quantum cryptography is capable of lifting both security and efficiency of blockchain. As a result, the scheme put forward in the article adopts quantum teleportation to implement secure communication. In addition, to assure the atomicity of cross-chain transactions that cross-chain asset exchanges succeed or fail simultaneously, a quantum time lock that improves the previous studies and combines quantum cryptography technology is proposed.", "source": "ieee", "author": ["Yu Cui"], "author_location": ["School of Information Engineering, North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCS55155.2022.9845967", "country": ["CN"], "citation": 0}

However, to fully realize such potential, Metaverse applications have to overcome various challenges such as massive resource demands, interoperability among applications, and security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose MetaChain, a novel blockchain-based framework to address emerging challenges for the development of Metaverse applications. In particular, by utilizing the smart contract mechanism, MetaChain can effectively manage and automate complex interactions among the Metaverse Service Provider (MSP) and the Metaverse users (MUs). In addition, to allow the MSP to efficiently allocate its resources for Metaverse applications and MUs\u2019 demands, we design a novel sharding scheme to improve the underlying blockchain\u2019s scalability. Moreover, to leverage MUs\u2019 resources as well as to attract more MUs to support Metaverse operations, we develop an incentive mechanism using the Stackelberg game theory that rewards MUs\u2019 contributions to the Metaverse.

With the help of ubiquitous wireless connections and powerful edge computing technologies, VR users in the wireless edge-empowered Metaverse can immerse themselves in the virtual through the access of VR services offered by different providers. However, VR applications are computation- and communication-intensive. The VR service providers (SPs) have to optimize the VR service delivery efficiently and economically given their limited communication and computation resources. An incentive mechanism can be thus applied as an effective tool for managing VR services between providers and users. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a learning-based Incentive Mechanism framework for VR services in the Metaverse. First, we propose the quality of perceptual experience as the metric for VR users immersing in the virtual world. Second, for quick trading of VR services between VR users (i.e., buyers) and VR SPs (i.e., sellers), we design a double Dutch auction mechanism to determine optimal pricing and allocation rules in this market. Third, for auction information exchange cost reduction, we design a deep reinforcement learning-based auctioneer to accelerate this auction process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve near-optimal social welfare while reducing at least half of the auction information exchange cost than baseline methods.", "source": "ieee", "author": ["Minrui Xu", "Dusit Niyato", "Jiawen Kang", "Zehui Xiong", "Chunyan Miao", "Dong In Kim"], "author_location": ["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore", "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore", "School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, China", "Pillar of Information Systems Technology and Design, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore", "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore", "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC45855.2022.9838736", "country": ["SG", "SG", "CN", "SG", "SG", "KR"], "citation": 22}

{"title": "Metaverse Native Communication: A Blockchain and Spectrum Prospective.", "date": "2022", "publish": "ICC Workshops", "abstract": "Metaverse depicts a vista of constructing a virtual environment parallel to the real world so people can communicate with others and objects through digital entities. In the real world, communication relies on identities and addresses that are recognized by authorities, no matter the link is established via post, email, mobile phone, or landline. Metaverse, however, is different from the real world, which requires a single identity belongs to the individual. This identity can be an encrypted virtual address in the metaverse but no one can trace or verify it. In order to achieve such addresses to hide individuals in the metaverse, re-mapping the virtual address to the individual\\'s identity and a specific spectrum to support the address-based communication for the metaverse are needed. Therefore, metaverse native or meta-native communications based on blockchain could be a promising solution to directly connect entities with their native encrypted addresses that gets rid of the existing network services based on IP, cellular, HTTP, etc. This paper proposes a vision of blockchain, encrypted address and address-based access model for all users, devices, services, etc. to contribute to the meta-verse.

Since virtual platform holds few restrictions in changing the surrounding environments or the appearance of the avatars, it can serve as a platform that reflects human thoughts or even dreams at least in the metaverse world. When it is merged together with the current brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, which enables system control via brain signals, a new paradigm of human interaction through mind may be established in the metaverse conditions. Recent BCI systems are aiming to provide user-friendly and intuitive means of communication using brain signals. Imagined speech has become an alternative neuro-paradigm for communicative BCI since it relies directly on a person\u2019s speech production process, rather than using speech-unrelated neural activity as the means of communication. In this paper, we propose a brain-to-speech (BTS) system for real-world smart communication using brain signals. Also, we show a demonstration of imagined speech based smart home control through communication with a virtual assistant, which can be one of the future applications of brain-metaverse system. We performed pseudo-online analysis using imagined speech electroencephalography data of nine subjects to investigate the potential use of virtual BTS system in the real-world.

In such environments readability, or indeed even legibility, may often be displaced through the usage of text and typography as a playful device, as artifacts which may manifest in puzzle-like configurations, or as visual structures the contents of which are meant to be understood through means other than straightforward reading, thus bringing about states of heightened engagement, wonder and \\'play\\' through their manipulation or indeed simply by being immersed within the spaces which are brought about through their very agency.

On the microscopic scale, PI principles give rise to unconventional transducers, which are especially useful for micro/nano-robot design with size and resource constrains. Since it is not easy to directly observe nanoscale multi-physics phenomenon, understanding their principles can be challenging. In this work, we bring PI principles into the metaverse to bridge this gap by developing two mixed reality scale models. The first example is a virtual reality (VR) 2D material twistronics visualizer to demonstrate the novel intelligent 2D materials with tunable properties as a rising field in condensed matter physics. Users can interactively control the cross-coupling multi-physics phenomena and observe the visualized material responses. The second example is centered around an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) to illustrate its imaging and probe principles. For interaction, users can control the twist angle using atomic lattice models and feel the AFM cantilever force using custom haptic devices.

As the vital foundation for building the Metaverse, social VR has been extensively examined by the computer graphics and HCI communities. However, there has been little systematic study dissecting the network performance of social VR, other than hype in the industry. To fill this critical gap, we conduct an in-depth measurement study of five popular social VR platforms: AltspaceVR, Horizon Worlds, Mozilla Hubs, Rec Room, and VRChat. Our experimental results reveal that all these platforms are still in their early stage and face fundamental technical challenges to realize the grand vision of Metaverse. For example, their throughput, end-to-end latency, and on-device computation resource utilization increase almost linearly with the number of users, leading to potential scalability issues. We identify the platform servers' direct forwarding of avatar data for embodying users without further processing as the main reason for the poor scalability and discuss potential solutions to address this problem.

Various devices, e.g., MR glasses, AR smartphones apps, or VR headsets, are becoming more affordable, and leader tech companies are heavily investing for a more immersive, realistic, and connected future. Lately, this vision of an interconnected virtual space for people to work, learn, play and share experiences with others has been formulated as the so-called \u201cMetaverse\u201d. This expected paradigm shift will heavily rely on XR, and hence implies an unprecedented amount of sensible data being collected about the users. Indeed, XR devices collect large amounts of sensitive data, including biometric data (e.g., eye gaze and body movement data) that are primarily used as Natural User Interfaces (NUIs) or for the proper functioning of technologies and services. However, research has identified a number of privacy and security threats rooting from this pervasive data collection, as well as privacy threats regarding XR inputs, outputs, user interactions and devices themselves. Still, further efforts must be made to guarantee the privacy and safety of users in a usable fashion in the future, and XR must be considered as a whole rather than as the sum of its parts to match the vision of the Metaverse. In this context, we propose to analyse the gap between user privacy perceptions in XR as a whole, and their concrete behaviour. The goal of this research is to understand the differences and similarities between AR, MR and VR in terms of user privacy perceptions. This will help us to better understand the relationships between XR variants, which, we argue, is an important requirement to approach the future evolution of these technologies, and to consider usable privacy aspects that match the entire XR spectrum.

However, since the conventional online environments typically provide simple streaming services using cameras and microphones, there have limitations in terms of physical expression and experiencing real-world activities such as cultural and economic activities. Recently, metaverse environments, three-dimensional virtual reality that use avatars, have attracted increasing attention as a means to solve these problems. Thus, many metaverse platforms such as Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite have been emerging to provide various services to users. However, such metaverse environments are potentially vulnerable to various security threats because the users and platform servers communicate through public channels. In addition, sensitive user data such as identity, password, and biometric information are managed by each platform server. In this paper, we design a system model that can guarantee secure communication and transparently manage user identification data in metaverse environments using blockchain technology. We also propose a mutual authentication scheme using biometric information and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to provide secure communication between users and platform servers and secure avatar interactions between avatars and avatars. To demonstrate the security of the proposed mutual authentication scheme, we perform informal security analysis, Burrows\u2013Abadi\u2013Needham (BAN) logic, Real-or-Random (ROR) model, and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA). In addition, we compare the computation costs, communication costs, and security features of the proposed scheme with existing schemes in similar environments.

However, creating custom 3-D content and environments for a digital world can be extremely time-consuming and costly compared to typical web pages. To this end, research in procedural content generation is required to empower the efficient creation of high-quality multimedia contents for the metaverse. One other core concern when creating a fully decentralized metaverse is the need to download relevant environments on demand as people traverse across different worlds. Further research by the multimedia community on efficient multimedia networking, storage, and compression is necessary to ensure that digital worlds remain easily accessible to others.", "source": "ieee_unknown", "author": ["Shu-Ching Chen"], "author_location": ["Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/MMUL.2022.3156185", "country": ["US"], "citation": 1}

In this paper, we present an initial analysis of the Quality of Experience (QoE) in the Metaverse. We first consider traditional influence factors (human, system, and context). Then, we introduce the social and economic dimensions of the Metaverse as additional factors to be considered for QoE assessment. Finally, we discuss what QoE assessment methods can be more suitable for Metaverse applications, with a particular focus on implicit assessment methods (e.g., physiological, human cognitive, affective behaviour).", "source": "ieee_unknown", "author": ["Simone Porcu", "Alessandro Floris", "Luigi Atzori"], "author_location": ["DIEE, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy", "DIEE, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy", "DIEE, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/QoMEX55416.2022.9900897", "country": ["IT", "IT", "IT"], "citation": 0}

{"title": "6G, Next G, and the Metaverse: Toward the Peak-Experience Machine.", "date": "2022", "publish": "CSNDSP", "abstract": "Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s invention of the printing press in 1450 revolutionized society and heralded 300 years of renaissance. While Gutenberg\u2019s invention gave birth to printing, the Internet\u2019s full potential still remains to be unleashed in the years to come. We do not yet know what the Internet truly is, though its impact is anticipated to be eventually similar or even superior to that of the printing press. Measured in Gutenberg time, we stand today at about the year 1481 with the progression of disruption in society. Note that Luther was born in the year 1483. Hence, the Internet\u2019s Martin Luther is yet to come. This paper aims at developing an overarching narrative for future 6G and Next G networks, which go beyond the incremental 6G= 5G +1G mindset of past generations of mobile networks and also involve major over-the-top Internet players, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, as well as Facebook. We focus particularly on the emerging Metaverse, the anticipated successor to today\u2019s mobile Internet, which will be about being inside the Internet (rather than simply looking at it from a phone screen) and producing peak-experiences. This is in contrast to only printing & pamphlets about them, as Luther had to do in a pre-Internet era.", "source": "ieee_unknown", "author": ["Martin Maier"], "author_location": ["Optical Zeitgeist Laboratory, INRS, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP54353.2022.9907941", "country": ["CA"], "citation": 0}

{"title": "Metaverse Learning: The Relationship among Quality of VR-Based Education, Self-Determination, and Learner Satisfaction.", "date": "2022", "publish": "BCD", "abstract": "While online learning had traditionally been implemented to aid in-person education, it has recently evolved into a critical tool for remote education. In particular, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the spread of online learning and its significance. However, this wave of innovation in the education field has revealed the lack of research on how online education should be systematically provided and which educational aspects should be considered to enhance learner satisfaction in online settings. With the recent emergence of the Metaverse, VR education is once again proposed as a major tool for online learning despite existing limitations in research which put both systematic and educational aspects into consideration. Hence, this study presents and discusses a research model that converges technology acceptance model, information systems success model, and self-determination theory with the purpose of exploring variables that affect learner satisfaction, mediating the flow theory. Results showed that most variables of both self-determination theory and information system quality within VR education impact learner satisfaction. In particular, learners\u2019 flow \u2013 complete immersion in learning \u2013 functions as an important mediating variable for learner satisfaction.

In particular, lots of changes occur rapidly due to the development of telecommunication and the introduction of new technologies, and also changes caused by COVID-19 have brought about great changes in all the areas of distribution and sales. In addition, the consumption of the MZ generation shows different patterns from the existing consumer generations, and a new change in distribution and sales start in earnest according as their influence grows. While metaverse platform services, which are yet in their early stages, are now used mostly by entertainment area and global large companies, it is deemed that continuous investment and technological innovation will accelerate the expansion of metaverse platforms. Currently, response to cosmetics industry in the metaverse platform market is trivial, but cosmetics industry will also have to provide services through the market of this new type before long. For this, it should understand the consumption tendency of the main consumers, and grope for marketing strategies responding to it. The strategies are as follows: First, the consumption patterns of the MZ generation, which will grow as a main consumer group in the future though they are not a current main consumption group, should be understood, and marketing methods should be developed in agreement with consumption patterns pursued by them. Second, PR and marketing embracing the values of the MZ generation, such as environment and value-based consumption should be carried out, and services of real-time communication through stories sympathized by the MZ generation should be provided. Third, while offline experience is important, the marketing of experience in metaverse platforms should be provided, and goods that enable two-way communication and simultaneous enjoyment should be provided by planning and developing goods that allow linkage between metaverse and offline, Lastly, it is deemed that strategies for attracting consumers by providing contents of amusement and fun should be used.", "source": "ieee_unknown", "author": ["Youngju Kim", "Hyeil Jung"], "author_location": ["Business Administration, SookMyung Woman\u2019s Univ., Seoul, South Korea", "Cosmedia.co.ltd, Seoul, South Korea"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/BCD54882.2022.9900806", "country": ["KR", "KR"], "citation": 0}
