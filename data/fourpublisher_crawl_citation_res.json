Scaling up the technology to large-sized environments and massively multi-user experiences thus represents one of the primary challenges to achieving such a vision. Due to these constraints, current proposals for the metaverse primarily consist of virtual worlds with little duality between physical and digital.

To fill this critical gap, in this paper, we take a first look at Workrooms, arguably a premature metaverse product released by Meta (a.k.a. Face-book). The goal of our study is to gain an in-depth under-standing of the current state of the metaverse and identify potential issues for improvement. Through extensive meas-urement studies, we dissect the underlying network support and demand of Workrooms. Our investigation reveals sev-eral interesting findings. For example, Workrooms utilizes different network flows to transmit virtual content and real-time multimedia content separately. This might be a prin-cipled approach that should be adopted in general. On the other hand, the current design of Workrooms faces imper-ative scalability challenges that should be addressed in any large-scale metaverse platform.", "source": "ieee", "author": ["Ruizhi Cheng", "Nan Wu", "Songqing Chen", "Bo Han 0001"], ",author_location": ["George Mason University", "George Mason University", "George Mason University", "George Mason University"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/VRW55335.2022.00040", "country": ["us", "us", "us", "us"], "ctmighterror": [0], "citation": 4}

Unique technology capabilities of metaverses have the potential to enhance the conduct of virtual projects, but little is known about virtual worlds in this context. Virtual project teams struggle in meeting stated project outcomes due to challenges related to communication, shared understanding, and coordination. One way to address these challenges is to consider the use of emerging technologies, such as metaverses, to minimize the impact on virtual project teams. Applying a theoretical foundation for virtual teams in metaverses that includes both technology capabilities and the social interaction that takes place in the metaverse environment, we conducted an empirical investigation of project teams in a virtual world setting. The study examined the interplay of communication, representation, interaction, and team process tools with behaviors that led to role clarity, shared understanding, and coordination. While each individual technology capability contributed to project execution and outcomes, much of the power of the environment emerged through the interplay of social behaviors and technology capabilities. The results have intriguing implications for how metaverse technology capabilities might provide new ways to address gaps in the current research and practice of virtual project management and virtual teams.", "source": "acm", "author": ["Dawn Owens", "Alanah Mitchell", "Deepak Khazanchi", "Ilze Zigurs"], "author_location": ["University of Nebraska at Omaha, Omaha, NE, USA", "Appalachain State University, Boone, NC, USA", "University of Nebraska at Omaha, Omaha, NE, USA", "UIniversity of Nebraska at Omaha, Omaha, NE, USA"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/1952712.1952717\n", "country": ["US", "US", "US", "US"], "citation": 32}

Besides, the enormous business potential hidden in metaverse has drawn a significant amount of funding to conduct a study on it. Technology companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others have set out the expansion of metaverse on a global scale. As a result, metaverse research has gradually increased in various countries, becoming a heated topic in China. The reason behind the metaverse's explosion is that people recognize the enormous future business value it holds. Still, they overlook the reality that education is the largest potential field of metaverse application. The metaverse and education have a natural parallel and overlap in terms of usability. In contrast to traditional education, the shared virtual space in the metaverse allows students to better participate in education and even become teachers of teachers. However, a substantial number of people are pessimistic about the metaverse's development and implementation, believing it to be a hoax. Therefore, a questionnaire scale is designed in terms of knowledge, exposure, current technology, and confidence to count people's faith in applying metaverse in education and teaching in the near future. The obtained survey data survey is analyzed using a combination of online and field visits, using both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The lack of understanding of metaverse, lack of faith in existing technology, and lack of awareness of the application of metaverse in education were determined to be the key variables affecting people's confidence in the future use of metaverse in education.

Peer-to-peer (or peer-assisted) technologies have been widely considered as a desirable complementary solution to efficaciously offload servers in large-scale media streaming applications. However, due to both the bandwidth constraints of heterogeneous users and unpredictable access patterns of latency-sensitive 3D contents, it is very challenging to cut the server bandwidth cost in metaverses. In this paper, we propose a peer-assisted texture streaming architecture to minimize the server bandwidth consumption without degrading the end-user satisfaction. We propose a game-theoretic peer selection strategy which achieves a good trade-off between performance and complexity. Our algorithm is light-weight, and can efficiently utilize the bandwidth of users in a fully decentralized manner by enabling each peer (i.e., user) to quickly select its content providers who can satisfy the requests of the peer within the latency constraint of the content. We evaluate our algorithm through an extensive comparison study based on simulations using realistic data (i.e., avatar mobility traces and textures) collected from Second Life. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the server bandwidth consumption without degrading the user experience.", "source": "acm", "author": ["Ke Liang 0001", "Roger Zimmermann", "Wei Tsang Ooi"], "author_location": ["National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore", "National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore", "National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/2072298.2072326\n", "country": ["SG", "SG", "SG"], "citation": 6}

Currently, users watch the RE\u2019s food through the gap between the user\u2019s face and the HMD (None) or superimposing a video see-through (VST) image on the VE, but these methods reduce the sense of presence. To allow natural eating in a VE, we propose Ukemochi that improves the presence and ease of eating. Ukemochi seamlessly overlays a food segmentation image inferred by deep neural networks on a VE. Ukemochi can be used simultaneously as a VE created with the OpenVR API and can be easily deployed for the metaverse. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of Ukemochi by comparing three visual presentation methods (None, VST, and Ukemochi) and two meal conditions (Hand condition and Plate condition). The experimental results demonstrated that Ukemochi enables users to maintain a high presence in VE and improve the ease of eating.

Syst.", "abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (VR) that utilizes head-mounted displays (HMD) is one of the key emerging technologies of the 21st century and has drawn keen attention from consumers, practitioners, and scholars in various disciplines. Nevertheless, the information systems (IS) discipline has neglected immersive VR, given that only a handful of studies have been published in mainstream IS journals. However, the recent advancements in immersive VR technology provide new opportunities for organizations and IS researchers. In light of these points, we reviewed the immersive VR literature to provide a holistic view of opportunities and challenges for organizations and future research directions for the IS field. By examining the technical capabilities of immersive VR and the previous literature, we identified five affordances: , , , , and . Our review of the 151 studies from the IS and related fields synthesized how these affordances were utilized in various research domains. Guided by the affordance-actualization theory, we also identified the strategic opportunities and challenges that come with implementing VR. The actualization of immersive VR affordances in organizations is indeed a fruitful area for IS scholars as there are various venues to move the IS field as well as the VR research in the organizational context forward.", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868722000130", "source": "elsevier", "author": ["Ersin Dincelli", "Alper Yayla"], "author_location": ["Department of Information Systems, Business School, University of Colorado Denver, 1475 Lawrence Street, 5102 Denver, CO 80202, USA", "Information and Technology Management Department, Sykes College of Business, University of Tampa, 401 W.

In addition, the proposed digital twin scheme can guarantee stringent requirements of reliability and low latency, which are highly applicable for the future networked systems of metaverse. For this first time in the literature, our paper addresses the optimal problem of the latency/reliablity in digital twins-enabled metaverse by optimizing various communication and computation variables, namely, offloading portions, edge caching policies, bandwidth allocation, transmit power, computation resources of user devices and edge servers.

This paper proposes the metaverse for aircraft maintenance training and education of Boeing-737, supplied with legacy manuals, 3D models, 3D simulators, and aircraft maintenance knowledge. Furthermore, to navigate and control operational flow in the metaverse, which is strictly followed by maintenance manuals, the context-aware speech understanding module Neuro-Symbolic Speech Executor (NSSE) is presented. Unlike conventional speech recognition methods, NSSE applies Neuro-Symbolic AI, which combines neural networks and traditional symbolic reasoning, to understand users\u2019 requests and reply based on context and aircraft-specific knowledge. NSSE is developed with an industrially flexible approach by applying only synthetic data for training. Nevertheless, the evaluation process performed with various automatic speech recognition metrics on real users\u2019 data showed sustainable results with an average accuracy of 94.7%, Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.5%, and the generalization ability to handle speech requests of users with the non-native pronunciation.

Blockchain technology plays an indispensable role in realizing the independent digital identity and economic system which are the significant attributes of the metaverse. To achieve the cross-universe mechanism and reduce network resource consumption, this paper proposes a cross-chain protocol for the underlying architecture of metaverse that utilizes an identity information chain to guarantee the separate digital identity of users and decrease the data interaction between varied consortium blockchains. However, along with the rapid development of quantum computing, the classical cryptosystems which commonly count on mathematical complexity will not be reliable and secure. The current post-quantum cryptography technologies that increase the time complexity of algorithm will lead to quite low efficiency and high resource overhead while applying to blockchain structures. But quantum cryptography is capable of lifting both security and efficiency of blockchain. As a result, the scheme put forward in the article adopts quantum teleportation to implement secure communication.

Specifically, by combining the experience of exploring a virtual house with retail information on items in that house, a consumer can virtually populate a house with desired items. This is particularly appealing for people, such as a couple getting married, who are looking to furnish an entire house with newly-purchased items. The system proposed in this paper provides this combination of realistic, 3D visualization and detailed product information.

{"title": "Wireless Edge-Empowered Metaverse: A Learning-Based Incentive Mechanism for Virtual Reality.", "date": "2022", "publish": "ICC", "abstract": "The Metaverse is regarded as the next-generation Internet paradigm that allows humans to play, work, and socialize in an alternative virtual world with an immersive experience, for instance, via head-mounted displays for Virtual Reality (VR) rendering. With the help of ubiquitous wireless connections and powerful edge computing technologies, VR users in the wireless edge-empowered Metaverse can immerse themselves in the virtual through the access of VR services offered by different providers. However, VR applications are computation- and communication-intensive. The VR service providers (SPs) have to optimize the VR service delivery efficiently and economically given their limited communication and computation resources. An incentive mechanism can be thus applied as an effective tool for managing VR services between providers and users. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a learning-based Incentive Mechanism framework for VR services in the Metaverse. First, we propose the quality of perceptual experience as the metric for VR users immersing in the virtual world. Second, for quick trading of VR services between VR users (i.e., buyers) and VR SPs (i.e., sellers), we design a double Dutch auction mechanism to determine optimal pricing and allocation rules in this market. Third, for auction information exchange cost reduction, we design a deep reinforcement learning-based auctioneer to accelerate this auction process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve near-optimal social welfare while reducing at least half of the auction information exchange cost than baseline methods.", "source": "ieee", "author": ["Minrui Xu", "Dusit Niyato", "Jiawen Kang", "Zehui Xiong", "Chunyan Miao", "Dong In Kim"], "author_location": ["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore", "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore", "School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, China", "Pillar of Information Systems Technology and Design, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore", "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore", "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC45855.2022.9838736", "country": ["SG", "SG", "CN", "SG", "SG", "KR"], "citation": 22}

{"title": "Metaverse Native Communication: A Blockchain and Spectrum Prospective.", "date": "2022", "publish": "ICC Workshops", "abstract": "Metaverse depicts a vista of constructing a virtual environment parallel to the real world so people can communicate with others and objects through digital entities. In the real world, communication relies on identities and addresses that are recognized by authorities, no matter the link is established via post, email, mobile phone, or landline. Metaverse, however, is different from the real world, which requires a single identity belongs to the individual. This identity can be an encrypted virtual address in the metaverse but no one can trace or verify it. In order to achieve such addresses to hide individuals in the metaverse, re-mapping the virtual address to the individual\\'s identity and a specific spectrum to support the address-based communication for the metaverse are needed. Therefore, metaverse native or meta-native communications based on blockchain could be a promising solution to directly connect entities with their native encrypted addresses that gets rid of the existing network services based on IP, cellular, HTTP, etc. This paper proposes a vision of blockchain, encrypted address and address-based access model for all users, devices, services, etc. to contribute to the meta-verse.

{"title": "Toward Imagined Speech based Smart Communication System: Potential Applications on Metaverse Conditions.", "date": "2022", "publish": "BCI", "abstract": "Metaverse provides an alternative platform for human interaction in the virtual world. Since virtual platform holds few restrictions in changing the surrounding environments or the appearance of the avatars, it can serve as a platform that reflects human thoughts or even dreams at least in the metaverse world. When it is merged together with the current brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, which enables system control via brain signals, a new paradigm of human interaction through mind may be established in the metaverse conditions. Recent BCI systems are aiming to provide user-friendly and intuitive means of communication using brain signals. Imagined speech has become an alternative neuro-paradigm for communicative BCI since it relies directly on a person\u2019s speech production process, rather than using speech-unrelated neural activity as the means of communication. In this paper, we propose a brain-to-speech (BTS) system for real-world smart communication using brain signals. Also, we show a demonstration of imagined speech based smart home control through communication with a virtual assistant, which can be one of the future applications of brain-metaverse system. We performed pseudo-online analysis using imagined speech electroencephalography data of nine subjects to investigate the potential use of virtual BTS system in the real-world. Average accuracy of 46.54 \u00b1 9.37 % and 75.56 \u00b1 5.83 % was acquired in the thirteen-class and binary pseudo-online analysis, respectively.

I am particularly focused upon the way in which such virtually three dimensional environments may place the usage of text within a context that stands in contradiction to its traditional one by creating an unexpected novel purpose which takes a marked departure from the intrinsic attribute with which text has inherently been associated - namely the attribute of readability. In such environments readability, or indeed even legibility, may often be displaced through the usage of text and typography as a playful device, as artifacts which may manifest in puzzle-like configurations, or as visual structures the contents of which are meant to be understood through means other than straightforward reading, thus bringing about states of heightened engagement, wonder and \\'play\\' through their manipulation or indeed simply by being immersed within the spaces which are brought about through their very agency.

With a trending Metaverse applications using augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), it is easier and interesting to teach sign language remotely using an avatar that mimics the gesture of a person using AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based system. There are various proposed methods and datasets for English SL (sign language); however, it is limited for Arabic sign language. Therefore, we present our collected and annotated Arabic Sign Language Letters Dataset (ArSL21L) consisting of 14202 images of 32 letter signs with various backgrounds collected from 50 people. We benchmarked our ArSL21L dataset on state-of-the-art object detection models, i.e., 4 versions of YOLOv5. Among the models, YOLOv5l achieved the best result with COCOmAP of 0.83. Moreover, we provide comparison results of classification task between ArSL2018 dataset, the only Arabic sign language letter dataset for classification task, and our dataset by running classification task on in-house short video. The results revealed that the model trained on our dataset has a superior performance over the model trained on ArSL2018. Moreover, we have created our prototype avatar which can mimic the ArSL (Arabic Sign Language) gestures for Metaverse applications. Finally, we believe, ArSL21L and the ArSL avatar will offer an opportunity to enhance the research and educational applications for not only the PwHL, but also in general real and virtual world applications.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new research work for exploring recent digital games inspired during the virus outbreak to support people in various aspects, such as entertaining people during the pandemic period, enhancing awareness among people about the virus, suggesting preventive measures against the spread of the virus. Next, more specifically, the impacts of COVID-19 on recent games from virtual and augmented realities are examined. We investigate metaverse games to support people during COVID-19 and the post-pandemic period, including enhancing the healthcare education toolkit, simulating health protection protocols, and supporting healthcare workers.", "source": "springer", "author": ["Chutisant Kerdvibulvech"], "author_location": ["Graduate School of Communication Arts and Management Innovation, National Institute of Development Administration, Bangkok, Thailand"], "keywords": ["Digital game", " Metaverse", " Virtual reality game", " Augmented reality game", " Coronavirus", " COVID-19"], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-06391-6_69", "country": ["TH"], "citation": 1}

{"title": "How Should We Suggest Colors to Creators in the Metaverse?", "date": "2022", "publish": "HCI (37)", "abstract": "Through surveying experienced users of metaverse platforms, we discovered that one of the challenges users face is to color new items used in the metaverse. Assisting users with coloring can be considerably effective because many metaverse platforms provide coloring and mapping development figures as a major means of creation. This method is widely used for creating new items and does not require users\u2019 proficiency in 3D modeling. Accordingly, we tried to lower the barrier of creation by developing the effective color suggestion method. Most of prior color suggestion studies focused on the algorithm [1\u20136] but the method is also an important aspect of color suggestion. Therefore, we designed comprehensive evaluation criteria by collecting users\u2019 feedback. We suggest \u201cKind of information\u201d, \u201cValue of information\u201d, \u201cNovelty\u201d, and \u201cRelevance\u201d as criteria for evaluating the color suggestion method. In the following experiment, participants colored a virtual item using two different color suggestion methods that had previously been utilized in previous experiments and without color suggestion. After the task, participants compared three different methods using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) pair-wise comparison with criteria we designed. As a result of the experiment, users preferred to be offered colors that matches the product rather than to be offered only set of colors and preferred to be offered only set of colors rather than not being offered any colors.", "source": "springer", "author": ["Junghun Lee", "Junho Yang", "Chunghun Ha"], "author_location": ["Department of Industrial Design, Hongik University, Seoul, Republic of Korea", "Department of Industrial Design, Hongik University, Seoul, Republic of Korea", "Department of Industrial Data Engineering, Hongik University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"], "keywords": ["Color suggestion", " Design assistant", " Metaverse", " User interface"], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-06417-3_29", "country": ["KR", "KR", "KR"], "citation": 0}

On the microscopic scale, PI principles give rise to unconventional transducers, which are especially useful for micro/nano-robot design with size and resource constrains. Since it is not easy to directly observe nanoscale multi-physics phenomenon, understanding their principles can be challenging. In this work, we bring PI principles into the metaverse to bridge this gap by developing two mixed reality scale models. The first example is a virtual reality (VR) 2D material twistronics visualizer to demonstrate the novel intelligent 2D materials with tunable properties as a rising field in condensed matter physics. Users can interactively control the cross-coupling multi-physics phenomena and observe the visualized material responses. The second example is centered around an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) to illustrate its imaging and probe principles. For interaction, users can control the twist angle using atomic lattice models and feel the AFM cantilever force using custom haptic devices.

As the vital foundation for building the Metaverse, social VR has been extensively examined by the computer graphics and HCI communities. However, there has been little systematic study dissecting the network performance of social VR, other than hype in the industry. To fill this critical gap, we conduct an in-depth measurement study of five popular social VR platforms: AltspaceVR, Horizon Worlds, Mozilla Hubs, Rec Room, and VRChat. Our experimental results reveal that all these platforms are still in their early stage and face fundamental technical challenges to realize the grand vision of Metaverse. For example, their throughput, end-to-end latency, and on-device computation resource utilization increase almost linearly with the number of users, leading to potential scalability issues. We identify the platform servers' direct forwarding of avatar data for embodying users without further processing as the main reason for the poor scalability and discuss potential solutions to address this problem. Moreover, while the visual quality of the current avatar embodiment is low and fails to provide a truly immersive experience, improving the avatar embodiment will consume more network bandwidth and further increase computation overhead and latency, making the scalability issues even more pressing.", "source": "acm", "author": ["Ruizhi Cheng", "Nan Wu", "Matteo Varvello", "Songqing Chen", "Bo Han 0001"], "author_location": ["George Mason University", "George Mason University", "Nokia Bell Labs", "George Mason University", "George Mason University"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3517745.3561417", "country": ["us", "us", "us", "us", "us"], "ctmighterror": [], "citation": 1}

Various devices, e.g., MR glasses, AR smartphones apps, or VR headsets, are becoming more affordable, and leader tech companies are heavily investing for a more immersive, realistic, and connected future. Lately, this vision of an interconnected virtual space for people to work, learn, play and share experiences with others has been formulated as the so-called \u201cMetaverse\u201d. This expected paradigm shift will heavily rely on XR, and hence implies an unprecedented amount of sensible data being collected about the users. Indeed, XR devices collect large amounts of sensitive data, including biometric data (e.g., eye gaze and body movement data) that are primarily used as Natural User Interfaces (NUIs) or for the proper functioning of technologies and services. However, research has identified a number of privacy and security threats rooting from this pervasive data collection, as well as privacy threats regarding XR inputs, outputs, user interactions and devices themselves. Still, further efforts must be made to guarantee the privacy and safety of users in a usable fashion in the future, and XR must be considered as a whole rather than as the sum of its parts to match the vision of the Metaverse. In this context, we propose to analyse the gap between user privacy perceptions in XR as a whole, and their concrete behaviour. The goal of this research is to understand the differences and similarities between AR, MR and VR in terms of user privacy perceptions. This will help us to better understand the relationships between XR variants, which, we argue, is an important requirement to approach the future evolution of these technologies, and to consider usable privacy aspects that match the entire XR spectrum. Adopting this vision early on will be beneficial for future work, and will be the foundation for the implementation of a usable privacy-preserving solution in order to raise awareness and empower users by giving them more control over their privacy in the context of these new and future technologies.", "source": "acm", "author": ["Chris Warin", "Delphine Reinhardt"], "author_location": ["Institute of Computer Science, University of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany", "Institute of Computer Science, University of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany and Campus Institute Data Science, Germany"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3549015.3554212\n", "country": ["DE", "DE"], "citation": 0}

However, since the conventional online environments typically provide simple streaming services using cameras and microphones, there have limitations in terms of physical expression and experiencing real-world activities such as cultural and economic activities. Recently, metaverse environments, three-dimensional virtual reality that use avatars, have attracted increasing attention as a means to solve these problems. Thus, many metaverse platforms such as Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite have been emerging to provide various services to users. However, such metaverse environments are potentially vulnerable to various security threats because the users and platform servers communicate through public channels. In addition, sensitive user data such as identity, password, and biometric information are managed by each platform server. In this paper, we design a system model that can guarantee secure communication and transparently manage user identification data in metaverse environments using blockchain technology. We also propose a mutual authentication scheme using biometric information and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to provide secure communication between users and platform servers and secure avatar interactions between avatars and avatars. To demonstrate the security of the proposed mutual authentication scheme, we perform informal security analysis, Burrows\u2013Abadi\u2013Needham (BAN) logic, Real-or-Random (ROR) model, and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA). In addition, we compare the computation costs, communication costs, and security features of the proposed scheme with existing schemes in similar environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has lower computation and communication costs and can provide a wider range of security features than existing schemes.

{"title": "Metaverse Learning: The Relationship among Quality of VR-Based Education, Self-Determination, and Learner Satisfaction.", "date": "2022", "publish": "BCD", "abstract": "While online learning had traditionally been implemented to aid in-person education, it has recently evolved into a critical tool for remote education. In particular, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the spread of online learning and its significance. However, this wave of innovation in the education field has revealed the lack of research on how online education should be systematically provided and which educational aspects should be considered to enhance learner satisfaction in online settings. With the recent emergence of the Metaverse, VR education is once again proposed as a major tool for online learning despite existing limitations in research which put both systematic and educational aspects into consideration. Hence, this study presents and discusses a research model that converges technology acceptance model, information systems success model, and self-determination theory with the purpose of exploring variables that affect learner satisfaction, mediating the flow theory. Results showed that most variables of both self-determination theory and information system quality within VR education impact learner satisfaction. In particular, learners\u2019 flow \u2013 complete immersion in learning \u2013 functions as an important mediating variable for learner satisfaction. These findings suggest designing and running a systematic platform that reflects self-directed learning is imperative to bring the best educational practices into the Metaverse.", "source": "ieee_unknown", "author": ["Gina Gim", "Hoikyoung Bae", "Seona Kang"], "author_location": ["Next Generation R&D Technology Policy Institute, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea", "Programs in Project Management, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea", "Programs in Project Management, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea\n"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/BCD54882.2022.9900629", "country": ["KR", "KR", "KR"], "citation": 0}

In particular, lots of changes occur rapidly due to the development of telecommunication and the introduction of new technologies, and also changes caused by COVID-19 have brought about great changes in all the areas of distribution and sales. In addition, the consumption of the MZ generation shows different patterns from the existing consumer generations, and a new change in distribution and sales start in earnest according as their influence grows. While metaverse platform services, which are yet in their early stages, are now used mostly by entertainment area and global large companies, it is deemed that continuous investment and technological innovation will accelerate the expansion of metaverse platforms. Currently, response to cosmetics industry in the metaverse platform market is trivial, but cosmetics industry will also have to provide services through the market of this new type before long. For this, it should understand the consumption tendency of the main consumers, and grope for marketing strategies responding to it. The strategies are as follows: First, the consumption patterns of the MZ generation, which will grow as a main consumer group in the future though they are not a current main consumption group, should be understood, and marketing methods should be developed in agreement with consumption patterns pursued by them. Second, PR and marketing embracing the values of the MZ generation, such as environment and value-based consumption should be carried out, and services of real-time communication through stories sympathized by the MZ generation should be provided. Third, while offline experience is important, the marketing of experience in metaverse platforms should be provided, and goods that enable two-way communication and simultaneous enjoyment should be provided by planning and developing goods that allow linkage between metaverse and offline, Lastly, it is deemed that strategies for attracting consumers by providing contents of amusement and fun should be used.", "source": "ieee_unknown", "author": ["Youngju Kim", "Hyeil Jung"], "author_location": ["Business Administration, SookMyung Woman\u2019s Univ., Seoul, South Korea", "Cosmedia.co.ltd, Seoul, South Korea"], "keywords": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/BCD54882.2022.9900806", "country": ["KR", "KR"], "citation": 0}

The topic of the metaverse is not new but an attractive topic that is gaining increased insight from researchers. This research focuses on a broader evaluation of the metaverse and its key elements and features of the metaverse. Even though metaverse is expected as a promising platform for information exchange and communication among internet users, it has several shortcomings such as requiring high-performance client terminals and a long response time in some cases. We address issues by introducing an interoperable Split- protocol with role changeover ability for resiliency and high availability of metaverse systems.
