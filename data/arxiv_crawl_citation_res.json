{"title": "A Dynamic Hierarchical Framework for IoT-assisted Metaverse Synchronization.", "publish": "CoRR", "date": "2022", "abstract": "Metaverse has recently attracted much attention from both academia and\nindustry. Virtual services, ranging from virtual driver training to online\nroute optimization for smart goods delivery, are emerging in the Metaverse. To\nmake the human experience of virtual life more real, digital twins (DTs),\nnamely digital replicas of physical objects, are key enablers. However, DT\nstatus may not always accurately reflect that of its real-world twin because\nthe latter may be subject to changes with time. As such, it is necessary to\nsynchronize a DT with its physical counterpart to ensure that its status is\naccurate for virtual businesses in the Metaverse. In this paper, we propose a\ndynamic hierarchical framework in which a group of IoT devices is incentivized\nto sense and collect physical objects' status information collectively so as to\nassists virtual service providers (VSPs) in synchronizing DTs. Based on the\ncollected sensing data and the value decay rate of the DTs, the VSPs can\ndetermine synchronization intensities to maximize their payoffs. In our\nproposed dynamic hierarchical framework, the lower-level evolutionary game\ncaptures the VSPs selection by the IoT device population, and the upper-level\ndifferential game captures the VSPs payoffs, which are affected by the\nsynchronization strategy, IoT devices selections, and the DTs value status,\ngiven VSPs are simultaneous decision makers. We further consider the case in\nwhich some VSPs are first movers and extend it as a Stackelberg differential\ngame. We theoretically and experimentally show that the equilibrium to the\nlower-level game exists and is evolutionarily robust, and provide a sensitivity\nanalysis with respect to various system parameters. Experiments show that the\nproposed dynamic hierarchical game outperform the baseline.", "source": "arxiv", "author": ["Yue Han", "Dusit Niyato", "Cyril Leung", "Dong In Kim", "Kun Zhu 0001", "Shaohan Feng", "Xuemin Sherman Shen", "Chunyan Miao"], "author_location": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.03969", "citation": 7}

Specifically, a virtual\nservice provider (VSP) which is responsible for creating and rendering the\nMetaverse, is required to use the data collected by IoT devices to create the\nvirtual copy of the physical world. However, due to the huge volume of the\ncollected data by IoT devices (e.g., images and videos) and the limited\nbandwidth, the VSP might become unable to retrieve all the required data from\nthe physical world. Furthermore, the Metaverse needs fast replication (e.g.,\nrendering) of the digital copy adding more restrictions on the data\ntransmission delay. To solve the aforementioned challenges, we propose to equip\nthe IoT devices with semantic information extraction algorithms to minimize the\nsize of the transmitted data over the wireless channels. Since many IoT devices\nwill be interested to sell their semantic information to the VSP, we propose a\ntruthful reverse auction mechanism that helps the VSP select only IoT devices\nthat can improve the quality of its virtual copy of objects through the\nsemantic information.

The industrial metaverses obtain data from various\nproduction and operation lines by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and\nthus conduct effective data analysis and decision-making, thereby enhancing the\nproduction efficiency of the physical space, reducing operating costs, and\nmaximizing commercial value. However, there still exist bottlenecks when\nintegrating metaverses into IIoT, such as the privacy leakage of sensitive data\nwith commercial secrets, IIoT sensing data freshness, and incentives for\nsharing these data. In this paper, we design a user-defined privacy-preserving\nframework with decentralized federated learning for the industrial metaverses.\nTo further improve privacy protection of industrial metaverse, a cross-chain\nempowered federated learning framework is further utilized to perform\ndecentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving data training on both physical\nand virtual spaces through a hierarchical blockchain architecture with a main\nchain and multiple subchains. Moreover, we introduce the age of information as\nthe data freshness metric and thus design an age-based contract model to\nmotivate data sensing among IIoT nodes.

{"title": "Security of Virtual Reality Authentication Methods in Metaverse: An Overview.", "publish": "CoRR", "date": "2022", "abstract": "The metaverse is said to be the future Internet and will consist of several\nworlds called verses. This concept is being discussed a lot lately, however,\nthe security issues of these virtual worlds are not discussed enough. This\nstudy first discusses the privacy and security concerns of the metaverse.\nVirtual reality headsets are the main devices used to access the Metaverse. The\nuser needs to verify their identity to log in to the metaverse platforms, and\nthe security of this phase becomes vital. This paper aims to compare the\nsecurity of the main authentication methods that are used in virtual reality\nenvironments. Information-based, biometric, and multi-model methods are\ncompared and analyzed in terms of security. These methods aim to verify the\nuser with different data types such as 3D patterns, PIN systems, or biometric\ndata. The pros and cons are discussed. The paper also concludes with what work\ncan be done to improve the safety of these authentication methods and future\nwork.", "source": "arxiv", "author": ["Pinar K\u00fcrt\u00fcnl\u00fcoglu", "Beste Akdik", "Enis Karaarslan"], "author_location": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2209.06447", "citation": 3}

{"title": "Big Data Meets Metaverse: A Survey.", "publish": "CoRR", "date": "2022", "abstract": "We are living in the era of big data. The Metaverse is an emerging technology\nin the future, and it has a combination of big data, AI (artificial\nintelligence), VR (Virtual Reality), AR (Augmented Reality), MR (mixed\nreality), and other technologies that will diminish the difference between\nonline and real-life interaction. It has the goal of becoming a platform where\nwe can work, go shopping, play around, and socialize. Each user who enters the\nMetaverse interacts with the virtual world in a data way. With the development\nand application of the Metaverse, the data will continue to grow, thus forming\na big data network, which will bring huge data processing pressure to the\ndigital world. Therefore, big data processing technology is one of the key\ntechnologies to implement the Metaverse. In this survey, we provide a\ncomprehensive review of how Metaverse is changing big data. Moreover, we\ndiscuss the key security and privacy of Metaverse big data in detail. Finally,\nwe summarize the open problems and opportunities of Metaverse, as well as the\nfuture of Metaverse with big data. We hope that this survey will provide\nresearchers with the research direction and prospects of applying big data in\nthe Metaverse.", "source": "arxiv", "author": ["Jiayi Sun", "Wensheng Gan", "Zefeng Chen", "Junhui Li", "Philip S.

{"title": "A Secure Authentication Framework to Guarantee the Traceability of Avatars in Metaverse.", "publish": "CoRR", "date": "2022", "abstract": "Metaverse is a vast virtual environment parallel to the physical world in\nwhich users enjoy a variety of services acting as an avatar. To build a secure\nliving habitat, it's vital to ensure the virtual-physical traceability that\ntracking a malicious player in the physical world via his avatars in virtual\nspace. In this paper, we propose a two-factor authentication framework based on\nchameleon signature and biometric-based authentication. First, aiming at\ndisguise in virtual space, we propose a chameleon collision signature algorithm\nto achieve the verifiability of the avatar's virtual identity. Second, facing\nat impersonation in physical world, we construct an avatar's identity model\nbased on the player's biometric template and the chameleon key to realize the\nverifiability of the avatar's physical identity. Finally, we design two\ndecentralized authentication protocols based on the avatar's identity model to\nensure the consistency of the avatar's virtual and physical identities.\nSecurity analysis indicates that the proposed authentication framework\nguarantees the consistency and traceability of avatar's identity. Simulation\nexperiments show that the framework not only completes the decentralized\nauthentication between avatars but also achieves the virtual-physical tracking.", "source": "arxiv", "author": ["Kedi Yang", "Zhenyong Zhang", "Youliang Tian", "Jianfeng Ma 0001"], "author_location": [], "link": "https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2209.08893", "citation": 0}
